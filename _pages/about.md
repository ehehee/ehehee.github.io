I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, working with [Prof. Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/). Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degree from Texas A&M University, advised by [Prof. Dezhen Song](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/dzsong/index.html).


My research interests encompass both theoretical and applied aspects of robotics, including active perception, dynamic scene understanding in structured and unstructured outdoor environments with uncertainties, as well as 3D scene understanding and reconstruction. Currently, my work focuses on developing probabilistic dynamic scene representations in sensor space and designing active perception-guided planning algorithms for mobile manipulators and agricultural robots.
