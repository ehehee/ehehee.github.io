I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering Department at Texas A&M University and my Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. Dezhen Song](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/dzsong/index.html). I am interested in topics related to the theoretical and application aspects of robotics,
such as perception-guided motion planning, dynamic scene understanding for outdoor structured and unstructured scenarios with uncertainties, and object recognition. My current research focuses on probabilistic dynamic scene representation in sensor space and active perception-guided mobile manipulator planning algorithms.
